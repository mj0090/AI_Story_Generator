# AI_Story_Generator
Introduction
<br>
The AI Dungeon Story Generator is an interactive text-based storytelling application that uses natural language generation (NLG) techniques to create engaging, genre-specific narratives. Inspired by classic text-based adventure games, this project allows users to input a prompt and receive multiple creative story continuations powered by advanced generative models. The goal is to simulate a dynamic dungeon master or storyteller capable of generating rich, immersive tales across multiple genres like fantasy, sci-fi, and mystery.
